        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="bio">
            Here a bit about me:
            <br><br>
            I am a theoretical particle physicist from Iran. I did my undergraduate studies at MIT and got my PhD at Harvard University, 
            where I worked with Matt Reece as my advisor. As of Sep. 2025, I am an NSF funded postdoctoral researcher at University of Chicago. 
            I study early universe cosmology; This entails: dark matter, physics of big bang and inflation,
             new hypothetical particles like axions, etc. 
            
            As an international student (particularly from Iran) it was quite confusing to navigate my way through US academia. 
            I decided to create this website to explain my tips and unsolicited advise for anyone who wants to take the journey.
            I am going to have a section about high school physics and preparations for international physics olympiad (which i did back in Iran). 
            I try to appeal to Iranian and non-iranian audience alike on this website, but this first section might be slightly more useful
            for my iranian audience. 
            The next chapters will focus on admission to US schools for undergrad, PhD programs, and finally postdoctoral positions. 
            I hope this website will help some of you over come the FOMO I always have felt as I was finding my way!
            
            P.S. I might decide to add other chapters on mental health and academic environment if time allows, but first things first!
